# Project Plan

## Title
**Impact of Gas Prices on E-Mobility Adoption and COâ‚‚ Emissions in the Americas**

## Main Question
How do fluctuations in gas prices influence the adoption of e-mobility  across regions in the Americas?

## Description
This project explores the relationship between gas prices and electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the United States. The hypothesis is that rising gas prices encourage EV adoptiondue to cost-saving motivations. A data pipeline was developed to preprocess, transform, and merge gas price and EV sales datasets for comprehensive analysis.

## Datasources
### Datasource1: EIA Gas Price Data
* **Metadata URL**: [US Energy Information Administration Gas Prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=w)
* **Dataset Direct URL**: [Gas Price Data (XLS)](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist_xls/EMM_EPM0_PTE_NUS_DPGw.xls)
* **Data Type**: XLS
* **Description**: Historical gas prices from the US Energy Information Administration, capturing weekly changes over time. This data is essential for analyzing the correlation between gas prices and EV adoption trends.

### Datasource2: Vehicles sales
* **Metadata URL**: [EV sales in diff states](https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/state-ev-registration-data/#data)
* **Dataset Direct URL**: [EV sales (CSV)](https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/state-ev-registration-data/#data)
* **Data Type**: CSV
* **Description**: Registration of EV vehicle in US
