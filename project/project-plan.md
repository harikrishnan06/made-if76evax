# Project Plan

## Title
**Impact of Gas Prices on E-Mobility Adoption and CO₂ Emissions in the Americas**

## Main Question
How do fluctuations in gas prices influence the adoption of e-mobility and its subsequent impact on CO₂ emissions across regions in the Americas?

## Description
This project investigates the relationship between gas prices, e-mobility adoption, and CO₂ emissions in the Americas. As fuel costs fluctuate, they can significantly impact consumer choices, particularly the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs). This analysis will use data on gas prices, EV adoption rates, and CO₂ emissions to explore how rising or falling gas prices affect the rate at which regions transition to e-mobility and reduce emissions. By employing statistical analysis and visualizations, the project aims to reveal patterns that could guide policymakers and industry stakeholders in fostering sustainable transportation initiatives.

## Datasources
### Datasource1: EIA Gas Price Data
* **Metadata URL**: [US Energy Information Administration Gas Prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=w)
* **Dataset Direct URL**: [Gas Price Data (XLS)](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist_xls/EMM_EPM0_PTE_NUS_DPGw.xls)
* **Data Type**: XLS
* **Description**: Historical gas prices from the US Energy Information Administration, capturing weekly changes over time. This data is essential for analyzing the correlation between gas prices and EV adoption trends.
